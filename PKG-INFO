Description: MOREESC is an application for the calculations of the auto-oscillations in wind instruments, designed originally for single reed instruments but it can be used for brass too. It takes advantage of a modal decomposition of the acoustic pressure field in the bore, or of its input impedance, to let you compute the sound of any strangely-shaped instrument.
